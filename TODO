simple
- carve out admsXML, make it optional (focus on tgt-gca development)
- check for python (version?)
- check for known-to-work gnucap
- should pass -DGNUCAP (or similar) to adms.
- get rid of compiler warnings
- missing variable prefixes (breaks some variable names)
- tests for qucs components.

medium
- finish vanilla gnucap compatibility
- get rid of MODULE (how?)
- get rid of bogus #ifdef's
- get rid of extra .hxx files
- cannot reuse existing device names (why?)
- weed out dead code and old function templates
- uninitialized and unused variables

hard/ambitious
- partial evaluation bypass
- replace admsXML (implement iverilog target)

experimental/incomplete
- ddx
- implicit equations

missing features
- topology detection, conditional internal nodes
- switching branches
- noise
- instaciate modules in spice using X
