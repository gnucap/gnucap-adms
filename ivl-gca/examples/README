here's (rougly) what we want to create from ../res.va.

example derived from gnucap-adms output. this is working, but suboptimal.

TODO:
- decruft
- merge into one file
- explain, add comments (!)
- get rid of MODEL_* classes
- allow instanciation in spice (Xres 1 2 res...)
- move evaluation to COMMON subdevice (see modelgen)
- later: more examples (such as cap.va, vcvs.va, ... )
